Pedagogical introduction to neutron stars


# Introduction
- should present wider context
- State its significance & novelty
- Define the research problem
- Technical methodology



# Main results and outlook


--------------------------------------------------

## Start with general introduction from first principles

Let us first build intuition starting from first principle physics.
Size of proton, electron
Mass
Empty space
Compression

## Neutron star compactness as a probe of GR
Compactness of Sun as comparison

## Born from ashes
conservation of mass
spin
magnetic field density


## How is the pressure evolving against density
Polytropes
Underlying requirements
How do they model more exact EOS

## TOV
Mass and radius
How is it compared to expectations of intuition


## Atmospheres
Hydro balance
Energy conservation
Jadadada

## Environment: surrounding disk
Usually in Binaries 
How often?
Why?

## Disk forms
What can we say about disks

## When the disk touches: Boundary layer
1000 Hz meets 500Hz
