Let us try and estimate the energetics of different phenomena of what we can observe from neutron stars.\mnote{Energy output}
Few possible stable sources of energy exists: thermal, gravitational, rotational, and magnetic.
In addition, unstable fusion processes can also power some observable phenomena.
