Neutrons stars are curious objects encompassing many still unsolved problems of modern physics and astrophysics.
Their unique nature makes them ideal laboratories for many of the most energetic phenomena in space.
Born from the ashes of a supernova, they begin their life only when some other normal star fades away and dies in a spectacular supernova explosion.%
\footnote{ For the pedantic ones, we specify that a supernova is actually an implosion followed by a subsequent explosion.}
From there on, they continue their life by slowly collecting the surrounding interstellar matter or by devouring an unlucky companion star floating next to them.
It is not the impressive $\sim 10^{30}$ kilograms they weight but the mere $\sim 10 \km$ in radius sphere that they encapsulate this material into that is then able to bend the spacetime itself.
Such an impressive feat rewards them with a categorization into a special stellar group called \textit{compact objects}.
Along with white dwarfs and black holes, these strange compact objects have been under a scientific scrutiny for almost nine decades now.
Still, some of the most fundamental questions remain:
What are neutron stars made of?
How big are they?
How do we see them?

In the next few sections, we will start our journey by building our intuition of these peculiar objects habiting the Space around us.
A short history of their discovery is given, followed by simple physical arguments why we actually expect them to exists in a first place.
Next, some actual observable phenomena is reviewed.
These are also closely connected to the surroundings and environments of the neutron stars, and hence those will be discussed and described also.


\section{Short history: from imagination into a reality}

%\subsection{History of degenerate electron gas and Chandrasekhar limit}
electrons as fermions\cite{Dirac25}
electron deg. pressure \cite{Fowler26}
elecs must be relativistic \cite{Anderson29}
equation of state for uniform density \cite{Stoner30}
Similar independent study by Landau \cite{Landau32}
full equation of state of degenerate electron gas unaware of Fowler \cite{Frenkel28} \cite{Yakovlev94}

Finally put together by Chandrasekhar \cite{Cha31} work done 5 years before Stoner.

%Neutrons
Neutron anticipated by Rutherford.\cite{Rutherford20}
Possible existence\cite{Chadwick32a}
Existence\cite{Chadwick32b}
Nobel prize 1935

%Neutron stars
Anticipation by theorist before the second World War. \cite{Landau32}
Before discovery of neutron?
\begin{displayquote}[Landau]
...the density of matter becomes so great that atomic nuclei come in close contact, forming one gigantic nucleus.
\end{displayquote}

Speculated in December 1933 by Baade and Zwicky in Meeting of the American Physical Society at Stanford.\cite{Baade34a}
and later published in Phys. Rev. \cite{Baade34aa}
\begin{displayquote}[Baade och Zwicky]
With all reserve we advance the view that a super-nova represents the transition of an ordinary star into a neutron star, consisting mainly of neutrons. Such a star may possess a very small radius and an extremely high density.
\end{displayquote}

Was deemed work of imagination from weird theorists.
A.G.W. Cameron, recalling his post-doc academic year 1959-1960 at Caltech reminds (Cameron, 1999): 
\begin{displayquote}
For years Fritz [Zwicky] had been pushing his ideas about neutron stars to anyone who would listen and had been universally ignored. 
I believe that the part of the problem was his personality, which implied strongly that \textbf{people were idiots if they did not believe in neutron stars}.
\end{displayquote}
Baade and Zwicky were apparently unaware of the work about the maximum mass of white dwarfs. 


In 1930 Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar applied Einstein’s theory of Special Relativity to the stellar structure when he was only 20, and developed the theory of white dwarfs (he was awarded the Nobel prize in 1983).

With John von Neumann, they obtained in 1934 the equations describing static spherical stars in Einstein’s theory of General Relativity but they didn’t publish their work.\cite{Baym82}

In 1937, Gamow and Landau proposed independently that a possible stellar energy source could be the accretion of matter onto a dense neutron core.
\red{source, image from K.S. Thorne?}

But very soon it was shown that stars are powered by thermonuclear reactions (as suggested in the 20s by Eddington and others). 
The interest in neutron stars then faded away.

%White dwarfs and neutorn stars
Connection between white drwards and neutorn stars.
It was Gamow who first made the connection in 1939. \cite{Gamow39}

At a conference in Paris in 1939, Chandrasekhar also pointed out
\begin{displayquote}
If the degenerate core attain sufficiently high densities, the protons and electrons will combine to form neutrons. 
This would cause a sudden diminution of pressure resulting in the collapse of the star to a neutron core.
\end{displayquote}
A neutron star should thus have a mass close to the Chandrasekhar limit, i.e. $M \sim 1.4\Msun$.



%TOV
Global structure was reveled in 1939.
Richard Tolman \cite{Tolman39}
and Robert Oppenheimer \& his student George Volkoff \cite{OV39}
reobtained independently the equations describing static spherical stars in General Relativity.
Oppenheimer and Volkoff solved these equations and calculated numerically the structure of non-rotating neutron stars.
Oppenheimer and Volkoff found $M_{\mathrm{max}} \approx 0.7\Msun$ by considering a degenerate gas of free neutrons.
Since this is smaller than the maximum mass of supernova cores, they concluded that neutron stars could not exist.

%Eos
The first “realistic” EoS of dense matter was constructed in the 50s by John Wheeler and his collaborators.\cite{Wheeler66}
For the crust, a semi-empirical mass formula was used together with the EoS of degenerate electrons. 
In the core, matter was assumed to be a mixture of three ideal Fermi gases (neutron, proton and electrons).


In 1959, Cameron constructed neutron-star models using the Skyrme equation of state for high-density matter. 
nuclear forces considerably stiffen the EoS
He found that $M_{\mathrm{max}} \approx 2\Msun$.
neutron stars can thus be formed as proposed by Baade and Zwicky
neutron star cores may contain various nuclear species such as hyperons.

%Hope of observing them
Formed in supernova explosions, neutron stars were thus expected to be "hot". 
In the 60s, theoretical efforts focused on modeling the cooling of neutron stars motivated by the hope of detecting their thermal emission.

First cooling calculations predicted surface temperatures $T \sim 10^6$ K for neutron stars $\sim 103$ year old.\cite{CS64}
a neutron star emits mainly in X-rays. 
So neutron stars were not expected to be seen from Earth because X-rays cannot penetrate the atmosphere.


%Observations
X-ray observations in space started in the 60’s with pioneer experiments by Riccardo Giacconi (Nobel Prize 2002).

Several X-ray sources were discovered but their nature remained elusive.

The activity was also focused on supernova remnant and a natural target was the Crab nebula.

During the 1920s and 1930s, the Crab nebula was identified as the remnant of a supernova that exploded on July 4, 1054.

A bright star was observed by Chinese, Japonese and Arab astronomers. 
The "star" remained visible in daytime for 23 days and disappeared from the night sky after two years.
Native Americans (Anasazi) might have also observed this event as suggested by the interpretation of a petroglyph in Chaco Canyon.

Already in 1942, Baade and Minkowski found that the central region of the Crab nebula contains an unusual star.

Subsequent theoretical efforts were focused on understanding the origin of the energy powering the Crab nebula.

A radio emission was detected in 1949. 
In 1953, Shklovsky predicted that this is due to synchrotron radiation by relativistic electrons spiraling along a strong magnetic field. 
Later the polarition of radio emission was confirmed. 

In 1964, Lodewijk Woltjer (who did his PhD with Jan Oort on the Crab nebula) argued that neutron stars could have very strong magnetic fields. \cite{Woltjer64}
This was also independently shown by Ginzurg. \cite{Ginzburg64}


The Crab nebula was observed during a lunar occultation on 7 July 1964. 
The size of the X-ray source was estimated as 1 light-year $10^{13}$ km (size of the nebula 11 ly). 
This was much larger than the typical size of a neutron star (10-20 km).

In 1967, Franco Pacini (who was a young postdoc at Cornell) showed that a rapidly rotating neutron star with a strong dipole magnetic field could power the Crab nebula.

In 1967, Iosif Shklovsky correctly proposed that Scorpius X-1 (found in 1962) is a neutron star accreting matter from a normal star. \cite{Shklovsky67}
But his work attracted little attention among astrophysicists

%PULSARs
On July 1967 everything changed because of Jocelyn Bell, a graduate student of Anthony Hewish in Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory.
Primitive antenna of wires strung on stakes in a pasture.

She discovered that the signal was pulsing with great regularity, at a rate of about one pulse per second. (1.3s)
Temporarily (jokingly) dubbed "Little Green Man 1" (LGM-1) the source (now known as PSR B1919+21) was identified after several years as a rapidly rotating neutron star.
Dupped as pulsar, short of pulsating radio source.
Later published in Nature 1968 by Hewish. \cite{Hewish68}


The other possibility was that pulsars are strongly magnetised rotating neutrons stars as proposed by Timothy Gold (and earlier by Pacini).
\cite{Gold68}

The discovery of the Crab and Vela pulsars definitevely established the nature of pulsars and confirmed the predictions of Baade and Zwicky 35 years earlier that neutron stars are the compact remnants of supernova explosions.

\red{X-ray bursts here}

The first millisecond pulsar was found in 1982 at Arecibo by Backer’s team

The theory of magnetars was proposed in 1992 by Robert Duncan, Christopher Thompson and Bohdan Paczynski to explain Soft Gamma Repeaters (SGR). SGRs are repeated sources of X and $\gamma$-ray bursts. \cite{DT92}

The first such object called SGR 0525-66 was discovered.
A very intense gamma-ray burst was detected on March 5, 1979 by two Soviet satellites Venera 11 and Venera 12.\cite{MGI79}



\section{From first principles to a neutrons star}

\subsection{Background: Sun and stars}
Let us first see, what can we learn from neutron stars using simple estimates and conservation laws.
Neutrons star are born from a death of a normal star.%
\mnote{Stellar orders of magnitude}
Most familiar such a star is our Sun \Ten{1.496}{13} \cm from us.%
\footnote{Throughout this thesis we will typically present our quantities only up to some fixed precision instead of the full litany of numbers.
We will also adopt the centimeter-gram-second (cgs) unit system instead of the (maybe) more common SI-system. 
Such a selection is sure to disappoint some, but try to endure.
}
With a mass of $\Msun = \Ten{1.99}{33} \g$ and radius of $R_{\odot} = \Ten{6.96}{10} \cm$, our Sun gives us an idea of the typical stellar size scales.
Curiously, these numbers also means that the mean density of the Sun is $\rho_{\odot} \approx 1.41 \gcm$, a mere $1.4\times$ the density of the water.

Like all stars, our Sun is held together by the inward pulling gravity.
Gravity does not prefer any direction more than some other and, just like we easily observe, a spherical object is expected to form.
In addition to the inward-facing force, an outward-facing force is needed to balance the system.
For normal stars this force is originating from the thermal pressure.

We observe stars in the night sky because they shine on us.%
\mnote{Thermonuclear fusion process}
This radiation, and also the origin of the thermal pressure, is from the thermonuclear fusion burning inside the star.
\textit{Thermo} here refers to the temperature and heat, \textit{nuclear} to the atomic nuclei, and \textit{fusion} to the process where elements are fused together.
During the thermonuclear fusion process, the star's core fuses light elements such as protons into heavier ones like helium.
Mass of two protons is less than a mass of one helium atom.
This mass difference between the start and end results is then transferred into energy in accordance to the Einstein's famous formula $E = mc^2$.
A whole sequence of such a fusions takes place inside the star where lighter elements are merged together building heavier and heavier elements.
This energy release from the mass-to-energy conversion will then give the star a sufficient thermal pressure support to keep it from not collapsing under the relentless gravity.

The fusion of elements does not continue forever.
In the beginning, two protons collide two form a helium.
In the next stage three helium nuclei collide to form a carbon, and so on, until iron is created.
Production of iron marks the end of the possible fusion chain because fusion of two iron cores does not release energy anymore, it requires it to take place.%
\footnote{This opens up another possibility of creating energy by splitting heavy elements. Such a process is called fission and is familiarly taken advantage of in earthly nuclear power plants.}
This iron produced, will then sink to the center of star forming a dead core without any energy input.

Like all big furnaces, at some point the stars will run out of fuel to burn.
What is then left behind is a inner core of iron with a subsequent onion-like layers of lighter and lighter elements.
Crucial question to ask next is: 
What is supporting this iron core now that the thermal pressure from the fusion processes are lost?
To answer this, we need to look inside the iron atom:
Iron nucleus, consisting of $26$ protons and $32$ neutrons, and surrounded by $26$ electrons, repulses its neighbors because of the negatively charged electron cloud does not want to get in touch with its neighbors flying next to it in the iron-atom lattice.
\footnote{More precise consideration shows that nickel ($^{56}_{28}\mathrm{Ni}$) is actually thermodynamically more favored in the core because of the lack of neutrons needed to synthesize iron-58 ($^{58}_{26}\mathrm{Fe}$).
}
It is this antisocial behavior originating from the electric charge repulsion that also gives internal support to our everyday materials and prevents us from not falling through the floor.
Electrons and protons inside the atom itself, on the other hand, are repulsing each other because of the quantum effects.
\red{explain quantum repulsion}

\subsection{Neutron stars at last}
From this setup it only takes a short step into realizing the existence of neutron stars.
What if at some point even these quantum effects are not enough to support the core?
Let us consider the consequences of this thought play.
More detailed calculations show that the resulting iron-core sitting at the center of the star is weighting at a maximum of around $\sim \Msun$.
Hence, there are $M_{\mathrm{core}} / m_{\mathrm{atom}} \sim \Msun / \mproton \approx \Ten{1.99}{33} \g / \Ten{1.67}{-24} \g \sim 10^{57}$ atoms trapped inside the core.
\footnote{
    The mass of the atom, $m_{\mathrm{atom}} = \mproton + \me$, is also approximated (to an excellent accuracy) by just considering the central nuclei alone as the electron mass $\me \approx \Ten{9.11}{-28} \g$ is negligible in comparison to the proton mass.
}
Here we are already considering not iron atoms but pure hydrogen atoms only to simplify the presentation.
Working backwards from these numbers, we can estimate the size of the core.



\subsection{Neutron star dimensions}
It turns out that Sun is also not as stable as one would think:
With a rotation period of about $25.5$ days it then takes Sun about a month to revolve around itself.
Similar to a bicycle dynamo hub, this rotation also gives rise to a detectable surface magnetic field of $B_{\odot} \approx 1 \Gauss$.%
\footnote{A typical refrigerator magnet is about $50\times$ stronger with a magnetic field of $50\Gauss$.}

A typical neutron star, on the other hand, weights about $M \sim 1.5\Msun$ but extends only up to $R \sim 10\km$.
Such dimensions give us an impressive mean density of $\rho \sim \Ten{7}{14} \gcm$.
In comparison, a typical nucleon (such as a neutron) weights about $\Ten{1.67}{-24} \g$ and has a radius of about $\Ten{1.25}{-13} \cm$, yielding us a nuclear density of $\nsat \approx \Ten{2}{14} \gcm$.
Hence, even the mean density inside the star is already on the same order of magnitude as the internal density inside nuclei.
This suggests us that the composition inside a neutron star is not our typical every-day matter.


Suppose a neutron star is, like any normal star, a blob of gas held together by the inwards pulling gravity.
Gravity does not prefer any direction more than some other and so a stable end-result is an isotropic configuration.
A pure inward pulling force is, of course, not enough so we also need a countering outward-facing force to resist the compression of the material.
As an first approximation, there is no need to assume that this force would have any preferred direction either.
Hence, our expected outcome is a sphere held together by the gravity originating from the mass $M$ of the matter itself.
Let us, for a while forget the exact origin and nature of the compression-resisting force and see what can we learn solely from the current information only.

\section{Connection to this thesis}
In this thesis we study many aspects of the neutron stars, their environment and the internal processes that will in the end help us in constraining the behavior of the ultra-dense matter inside the star.
