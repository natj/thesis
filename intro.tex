Neutrons stars are curious objects encompassing many still unsolved problems of modern physics and astrophysics.
Their unique nature makes them ideal laboratories for many of the most energetic phenomena in space.
Born from the ashes of a supernova, they begin their life only when some other normal star fades away and dies in a spectacular supernova explosion.%
\footnote{ {For the pedantic ones, we specify that a supernova is actually an implosion followed by a subsequent explosion.}}
From there on, they continue their life by slowly collecting the surrounding interstellar matter or by devouring an unlucky companion star floating next to them.
It is not the impressive $\sim 10^{30}$ kilograms they weight but the mere $\sim 10 \km$ in radius sphere that they encapsulate this material into that is then able to bend the spacetime itself.
Such an impressive feat rewards them with a categorization into a special stellar group called \textit{compact objects}.
Along with white dwarfs and black holes, these strange compact objects have been under a scientific scrutiny for almost nine decades now.
Still, some of the most fundamental questions remain:
What are neutron stars made of?
How big are they?
How do we see them?

In the next few sections, we will start our journey by building our intuition of these peculiar objects habiting the Space around us.
A short history of their discovery is given, followed by simple physical arguments why we actually expect them to exists in a first place.
Next, some actual observable phenomena is reviewed.
These are also closely connected to the surroundings and environments of the neutron stars, and hence those will be discussed and described also.


\section{Short history: from imagination into a reality}
Anticipation by theorist before the second World War. \cite{Landau32}
\begin{displayquote}[Landau]
...the density of matter becomes so great that atomic nuclei come in close contact, forming one gigantic nucleus.
\end{displayquote}

Blaablaa\cite{Baade34a}
\begin{displayquote}[Baade och Zwicky]
With all reserve we advance the view that a super-nova represents the transition of an ordinary star into a neutron star, consisting mainly of neutrons. Such a star may possess a very small radius and an extremely high density.
\end{displayquote}

Work of imagination from weird theorists.
On July 1967 everything changed because of Jocelyn Bell, a graduate student of A. Hewish in Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory.

She discovered that the signal was pulsing with great regularity, at a rate of about one pulse per second. 
Temporarily dubbed "Little Green Man 1" (LGM-1) the source (now known as PSR B1919+21) was identified after several years as a rapidly rotating neutron star.
Later published in Nature 1968 by Hewish. \cite{Hewish68}



\section{From first principles to a neutrons star}
Let us first see, what can we learn from neutron stars using simple estimates and conservation laws.

Suppose a neutron star is, like any normal star, a blob of gas held together by the inwards pulling gravity.
Gravity does not prefer any direction more than some other and so a stable end-result is an isotropic configuration.
A pure inward pulling force is, of course, not enough so we also need a countering outward-facing force to resist the compression of the material.
As an first approximation, there is no need to assume that this force would have any preferred direction either.
Hence, our expected outcome is a sphere held together by the gravity originating from the mass $M$ of the matter itself.
Let us, for a while forget the exact origin and nature of the compression-resisting force and see what can we learn solely from the current information only.


Neutrons star are born from the death of a normal star.%
\mnote{Orders of magnitude}
Most familiar such a star is our Sun \Ten{1.496}{13} \cm from us.%
\footnote{Throughout this thesis we will typically present our quantities only up to some fixed precision instead of the full litany of numbers.
We will also adopt the centimeter-gram-second (cgs) unit system instead of the (maybe) more common SI-system. 
Such a selection is sure to disappoint some, but try to endure.
}
With a mass of $\Msun = \Ten{1.99}{33} \g$ and radius of $R_{\odot} = \Ten{6.96}{10} \cm$, our Sun then introduces us some typical stellar dimensions.
Curiously, this means that the mean density of the Sun is $\rho_{\odot} \approx 1.41 \gcm$, a mere $1.4\times$ the density of the water.
It turns out that Sun is also not as stable as one would think:
With a rotation period of about $25.5$ days it then takes Sun about a month to revolve around itself.
Similar to a bicycle dynamo hub, this rotation also gives rise to a detectable surface magnetic field of $B_{\odot} \approx 1 \Gauss$.%
\footnote{A typical refrigerator magnet is about $50\times$ stronger with a magnetic field of $50\Gauss$.}

A typical neutron star, on the other hand, weights about $M \sim 1.5\Msun$ but extends only up to $R \sim 10\km$.
Such dimensions give us an impressive mean density of $\rho \sim \Ten{7}{14} \gcm$.
In comparison, a typical nucleon (such as a neutron) weights about $\Ten{1.67}{-24} \g$ and has a radius of about $\Ten{1.25}{-13} \cm$, yielding us a nuclear density of $\nsat \approx \Ten{2}{14} \gcm$.
Hence, even the mean density inside the star is already on the same order of magnitude as the internal density inside nuclei.
This suggests us that the composition inside a neutron star is not our typical every-day matter.
