Comments on the 4 introductory chapters of Joonas Nattila's PhD thesis

These introductory chapters are impressive in their thoroughness. They
are much more thorough than I have ever seen in other theses. On the one
hand it is nice to have such a complete description, but on the other hand
is the text (necessarily I presume) at places quite condensed and difficult to
follow.

Here are some comments, first some general ones and then some on details.


There sometimes is a striking contrast between a fairly deep level of
discussion and a loose and incidentally inaccurate use of
language. Examples of this are "For the pedantics", "bunch of weird
astronomers", "litany of numbers", "quark matter, though*...*", "Like
all big furnaces", "star floating (in space)", "excluding dark matter
though...", "poor companion and slowly devours it", "spiced up",
"angular frequency", "try to endure", "pines theorem" and "circular
object". This may be a matter of taste/style, but it sometimes goes a
little beyond that I would say.

inaccurate use of language:
x "For the pedantics", 
x "bunch of weird astronomers", 
x "litany of numbers", 
x "quark matter, though*...*", 
o "Like all big furnaces", 
x "star floating (in space)", 
? "excluding dark matter though...", 
o "poor companion and slowly devours it",
x "spiced up",
x "angular frequency", 
x "try to endure", 
o "pines theorem" 
x "circular object". 
DONE: Corrected ones with (x). 
DONE: Left ones with (o) as I personally think some color can be put into the text.


There are a considerable amount of minor language errors, in
particular the inappropriate use of articles and plural forms and
sometimes the verbalization of adjectives (e.g., "matriculate"). I
suggest that a native English speaking person goes over the text and
corrects this. That should be an easy fix. Related to this: in the
thesis title I think "gauge of" would be preferred over "gauge for".
DONE.

Chapter 1 is a very nice introduction that should be easily
comprehensible to the general educated readership. One might perhaps
like to have mentioned Lev Landua's work from a historical
perspective, but this is not very important. There is a striking
absence of illustrations and of citations on pages 10-15 (so running
into chapter 2).



Chapter 2 is a very relevant rather in-depth discussion of the
internal structure and the (radiation transfer in the) atmosphere of
the neutron star - the target of this thesis. The overview of states
of matter and the equations of state is very nice. Ffor the non-expert
in quantum mechanics and radiation transfer, such as myself, this is a
difficult chapter because of the use of 'jargon', the many unexplained
equations and the sparse explanation of concepts. Examples are 'Fermi
energy' (not really explained), relativistic effects (by the way, I miss a
mention of gravitational redshift), and generally the text in the second part
of section 2.4. The author expect a considerable level of prior knowledge
here, and this prompts the question whether the text is not too
difficult for the non-expert and too trivial for the expert. This is
not withstanding that I am impressed with the courage to
go into these details, and to solve the TVO equations oneself!

DONE. Made it easier now for Fermi energy & chemical potential.


Chapter 3 is interesting, but somewhat puzzling. The title is
'Astrophysics around neutron stars', but section 3.2 discusses X-ray
bursts which I would not categorize as such. More importantly, there
appears to be an imbalance in the attention given to accretion flows
and X-ray bursts (9:1 page wise). An inverse ratio of attention would
seem to reflect the core science of the thesis better. For instance,
more attention could have been given to the rp process because the
signal of that is potentially confusing the cooling signal that is so
important in this thesis. The binary environment of accretion is
introduced a little late in this chapter.


Chapter 4 is very nice and an excellent introduction to the work of
the candidate for an expert. No general comments here!

One subject that I miss is Bayesian statistics on which the author has
made an important contribution to the field by introducing it in the
detail of X-ray burst spectral analysis.

Follow minor comments:

p.1
- last line of par 1: "how big" neutron stars are is not a fundamental question
- no capital in "Space" 
Done

p.8
- Los Alamos -> Los Alamos National Laboratory
- Paradjis -> Paradijs
Done

p.15
par 2: the actual size of the start is not unconstrained but poorly constrained
Done

p.16
- Figure 2.1 is not referenced in the text
- Earthly laboratories -> laboratories on Earth
- footnote: it may be a bit confusing to discuss an atomic density of
 the element of Osmium when elsewhere nuclear densities are discussed
Done

p.17
caption: upper *horizontal* axis
Done

p.18
- section 2.2.1 is called general relativistic effects but the
 discussion of such effects is basically absent. It refers only to the
 u parameters. Furthermore redshift is not mentioned.
- neutrons star -> neutron star (DONE)
- is iron the most stable chemical element on the surface of the neutron star
 or is it the most abundant stable element there?
 It is the most stable.


p.25
- I fail to comprehend Eqs. 2.33 and 2.34, because Fermi energy and chemical
 energy are not well enough explained for me
 Expanded and improved the definition of Fermi energy and chemical potential.


p.41
- "one source to another" -> "one star to another" (although one would
 then have to introduce binaries first)
- 1st sentence of 3.1 ("Accretion..has its roots in..energy") is somewhat
 off-center. I would say it has its roots in gravity-period. It happens
 in non-compact objects as well, with shallower potential wells.
 Corrected.

p.42 
- "devours it until nothing is left" -> that appears like too quick a
 statement. If the secondary shrinks under its Roche lobe, it will
 not be consumed in whole. The evolution of the orbit should at least
 be mentioned. The orbit widens because of the changing mass ratio
 and shrinks because of GWs.  If the secondary is left to be a white
 dwarf, it may not be completely consumed.
 Changed to consume instead of devour.

p.48
- The disk could be said to switch between three states: hard, soft and
 off/cold/quiescent.
 Added.
- "The end result is always the same" is quite an inaccurate statement.
Corrected.

p.52
"do not fully understand yet" -> perhaps this could be backed up with some
discussion or with appropriate references?
Referenced Kuuttila et al 2017 and in't Zand et al 2017.

p.53
- last sentence "In practice..play a huge role." One could argue
 conversely that this is a motivation to use X-ray bursts for
 understanding the physical processes in the immediate neighborhood
 of the neutron star. And that, on its turn, increases the potential
 of X-ray burst for understanding the neutron stars themselves. See
 also page 58. "Every disadvantage has its advantage", as a famous
 football player and coach used to say..
 Could but didn't.

p.54
bottom line: *photon* energy
Done
